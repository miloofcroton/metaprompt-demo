## Overview

Build a simple React todo app in two phases: first establish the project foundation with Vite, React Router, and shell/page architecture, then implement the todo list functionality with basic CRUD operations.

## Domain Expertise

None

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation** — Vite + React + TypeScript setup with React Router and shell/page architecture
- [ ] **Phase 2: Todo Feature** — Todo list page with add, toggle, delete functionality

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Working Vite + React + TypeScript project with React Router, shell component with nav bar, and welcome page at root

### Phase 2: Todo Feature
**Goal**: Functional todo list at /todo with add, checkbox toggle, and delete
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Unlikely (basic React state management)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: Todo list implementation
