# Roadmap Archive: v1.0 — MVP Todo App

**Completed:** 2025-12-28

## Overview

Build a simple React todo app in two phases: first establish the project foundation with Vite, React Router, and shell/page architecture, then implement the todo list functionality with basic CRUD operations.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation** — Vite + React + TypeScript setup with React Router and shell/page architecture
- [x] **Phase 2: Todo Feature** — Todo list page with add, toggle, delete functionality

## Phase Summaries

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Working Vite + React + TypeScript project with React Router, shell component with nav bar, and welcome page at root

**Duration:** ~8 min | **Plans:** 1 | **Files:** 17

**Accomplishments:**
- Scaffolded Vite + React + TypeScript project with all dependencies
- Created Shell component with navigation bar and Outlet for child routes
- Set up React Router v6 with createBrowserRouter pattern
- Implemented Welcome page with link to todo app
- Created placeholder TodoPage for Phase 2

**Key Decisions:**
- Used createBrowserRouter pattern (React Router v6 recommended approach)
- Kept styling minimal and inline for now (no CSS framework per project constraints)

**Deviations:**
- Vite scaffolding failed in non-empty directory; workaround: created in temp directory then copied

### Phase 2: Todo Feature

**Goal**: Functional todo list at /todo with add, checkbox toggle, and delete

**Duration:** ~2 min | **Plans:** 1 | **Files:** 1

**Accomplishments:**
- Implemented Todo type with id, text, and completed fields
- Created state management with useState for todos array and input text
- Built CRUD handlers: addTodo, toggleTodo, deleteTodo
- Implemented full UI with input, add button, todo list with checkboxes, and delete buttons
- Added Enter key handling for quick todo entry
- Styled completed items with strikethrough

**Key Decisions:**
- Used Date.now() for unique IDs (simple, works for in-memory state)
- Kept styling minimal with inline styles (per project constraints)
- Added empty state message for UX clarity

**Deviations:** None
